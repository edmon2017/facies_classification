Geological facies classification using Random Forest

The goal of project is to create a model to predict geological facies, using well logs information. The geological facies are categories which helps to underStand the rock properties and this is a keys information to understand the behavior of the rocks in the subsurface, this information is required for the subsurface analysis in different areas like mining, oil and gas and carbon storage.

In the subsurface analysis the facies can be identified in perforation cores, however that informacion is very expensive and sparse. In other way, well logs are rutinary acquired in each log drilled and have a largest coverage including in some cases the entire well.

For this project, we are going to use a dataset contain well logs and facies information from different wells. This information was obtained for this repository (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imeintanis/well-log-facies-dataset?resource=download)
